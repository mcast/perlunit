  This is out of date in places.  I haven't investigated which places.

  Note that there are multiple bug trackers, listed here in what mca
  considers the order of preference,

    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2653&atid=102653
    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Test-Unit
    http://bugs.debian.org/libtest-unit-perl

  Also note use of ChangeLog instead of Changes, and parts of doc/TODO

-------------------------------------------------
The procedure should be:
-------------------------------------------------

1. Ensure files are committed		git status

2. Update ChangeLog			git log --stat --reverse --decorate v0.25..HEAD

3. Ensure working copy is clean		git clean -xdn
   Change last n to f to delete them!

4. Tag it, if it is a full release	git tag -m 'mumble is out' v0.mumble

5. Fresh Makefile			perl Makefile.PL

   This can make new dev tags, iff not on a release tag.

   The insistence on clean working copy might be annoying, but is
   probably necessary to avoid mistakes.

6. Check the manifest			make distcheck

   nb. exit code is not indicative of success, read the output.  If
   files are "Not in MANIFEST",

   Add to MANIFEST.SKIP ?
   Update the manifest			make manifest

   Check & commit differences
   Start again

7. Test the distribution		make disttest

XXX: why does it make noise and complain that (most files in the manifest) are missing, before proceeding to build & test them?

   This should cover all the tests and the examples; but examples are
   broken (0.25).

8. Ship it				make tardist

   Unpack and test it one more time!

   Upload to Sourceforge FRS
   Upload to PAUSE

   Do tags need pushing?		git push -n
   Delete some dev tags?
   Push the relevant tag(s)		git push

9. Delete recent dev tags		dist-tools/devtag-bye -d -f

10. Check CPAN knows you own all modules in the dist.
	curl -s http://www.cpan.org/modules/06perms.txt.gz | zcat | grep -E '^$|: |^Test::Unit' | less

    Existing modules should be OK (but are not, as of 2011-04).
    New modules get first-come registration after upload.


-------------------------------------------------
Explanation on version number synchronization:
-------------------------------------------------

The CPAN module will decide to upgrade a module when the version number
of the module installed locally is less than the highest version number
of any version of the module it can find on CPAN. It will find out the
distribution file this module is in, and then install this distribution
file. This can lead to surprising results for distribution files that
contain multiple modules.

Take this common situation: package Foo-0.22.tar.gz contains modules
Foo, Foo::Bar, and Foo::Baz. Now, something changes in Foo::Bar, and
Foo::Bar gets a new version number. The module author happily uploads
Foo-0.23.tar.gz to CPAN.

Now, will the CPAN module use Foo-0.23.tar.gz to upgrade package Foo if you
tell it "install Foo"? No. CPAN will look at the version number for Foo,
determine it has not changed compared to the locally installed version,
and do nothing. You have to tell it "install Foo::Bar" to get the new
distribution file, which is bad, since nobody will know she has to
do that.

The solution is to make sure any time a distribution file gets upgraded,
its top level module should get a new, higher version number.  This way,
things will work like people expect them to work.

Please note that any module on CPAN should have a version number, even
if it is contained in a package with many other modules. This ensures
that people can require a certain version of any module in a given
distribution file.

[SNIP, old and CVS-related]

    - Changes (section for release at the top)
[SNIP]
    - README (Version numbers on installation commands .. surely we
      could put something generic in here?)

So we've a solution to this separate problem, but perhaps we should
hold off the feature creep until we've got more tests in?

(any bright ideas for ways to tie the docs to the tests so the can
fail a test when we tweak things? I'm just about to digress hugely so
I'll save it for another post)
